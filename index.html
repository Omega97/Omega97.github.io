    <!--This section contains some info about me-->
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        While pursuing my bachelor’s degree I developed familiarity with complex problems in math and physics,
        analytical thinking and problem-solving skills that have proven valuable in approaching challenges from a
        logical perspective. I give my best when I’m working on projects that I am passionate about.
        My experience with chess taught me to stay calm under pressure and to look for a better solution for any
        given problem.
        I am passionate about programming, numerical simulations and artificial intelligence.

        <h3>Internship in astrophysical data analysis</h3>
        <p>I created a GitHub repository that allows to study the local correlation between two
            HEALPix images. It was an open-ended problem for which I had to come up with my own
            solution to the problem.
