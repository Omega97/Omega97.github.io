    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        While pursuing my bachelor’s degree I developed familiarity with complex problems in math and physics,
        analytical thinking and problem-solving skills that have proven valuable in approaching challenges from a
        logical perspective. I give my best when I’m working on projects that I am passionate about. <br />
        My experience with chess taught me to stay calm under pressure and to look for a better solution for any
        given problem. <br />
        I am passionate about programming, numerical simulations and artificial intelligence.

        <h3>Internship in Astrophysical Data Analysis for Sky-map Correlation</h3>
        <p>
            I created a
            <a href="https://github.com/Omega97/skymap_correlation">GitHub repository</a>
            that allows us to study the local correlation map between two HEALPix sky-maps.
            The problem was open-ended, and I had to come up with my own solution, which was
            to make a library for calculating the local correlation efficiently.

        <h3>Survay of </h3>
        <p>
            Survey of various image classifiers, and the resilience of GradCAM to perturbations.
        </p>

    <div class="project">
        <h3>Mini-Hold'Em</h3>
        <p>
            In 
            <a href="https://github.com/Omega97/GMOOptimizationProject">this project</a>
            , I tested how evolutionary algorithms perform in mastering hidden information 
            card games of various degrees of complexity. Mini-Hold'em is a simplified version 
            of Poker Texas hold'Em. The bot is able to achieve human-level play for simpler 
            versions of the game, but it struggles when variability is too high.

        <h3>Mancala Self-reinforcement Learning AI</h3>
        <p>
            I created a self-reinforcement learning AI
            <a href="https://github.com/Omega97/mancala">self-reinforcement learning AI</a>
            for the game of Mancala. The agent uses MCTS to choose the best move. A neural-network-based
            policy is used to guide the search. Roll-outs are performed to evaluate the leaf nodes.
            The roll-outs are truncated and evaluated with a value network. Both the value net and the policy are
            trained on self-play data, generated with the help of a custom Mancala simulator that I created.

        <h3>Wiki-tok</h3>
        <p>
            This group project implements a recommendation system of Wikipedia pages. The user can 
            provide feedback for each page, and then he is fed with the next one, just like with the app TikTok.

        <h3>Search Heuristics</h3>
        <p>
            In the rich and well-studied field of optimization, one generic use case is to find the 
            best one among a set of random variables, trading off between reward and exploration cost. 
            <a href="https://github.com/Omega97/SearchHeuristic">This small project</a>
            provides a simple implementation and comparison of some of the best-performing heuristics, 
            ready to be applied in real-world scenarios.

    <div class="project">
        <h3>Quantum Logic Gates</h3>
        <p>
            In this project, I tested my knowledge of quantum mechanics by creating a
            <a href="https://github.com/Omega97/quantum_logic_gates">repository</a>
            that contains a library for simulating quantum logic gates. The library enables the user to
            visualize the process of applying quantum operators and perform simple quantum algorithms.

    <div class="project">
        <h3>Steganography</h3>
        <p>
            I created a
            <a href="https://github.com/Omega97/steganography">repository</a>
            that allows you to explore how steganography effects the individual bits of an image.

            <a href="https://github.com/Omega97/neural_net_from_scratch">repository</a>
            that I created allowed me to create and train a neural network from scratch.
            This effort tested my knowledge and understanding of the subject.

        <h3>Ramanujan Machine</h3>
        <p>
            The
            <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.00205">Ramanujan Machine</a>
            is a tool based on continued fractions and gradient descent. It allows finding interesting
            equations for important mathematical constants. I created a
            <a href="https://github.com/Omega97/Ramanujan_Machine">GitHub repository</a>
            that successfully implemented this tool, and it got featured in a
            <a href="https://youtu.be/BXw8vQXxvqc?list=PLOjBt28t6kTvm_7W2lwWzEmXSJLWGaL5V&t=2205">Youtube video</a>

    <div class="project">
        <h3>Quantum Ground State Simulation</h3>
        <p>
            Using my knowledge of quantum mechanics, I created a
            <a href="https://github.com/Omega97/quantum_ground_state_simulation">repository</a>
            that allows you to simulate the ground state of a quantum system of interacting particles.
            Given the potential, the program will find the ground state of the system using the variational method.
            The program makes the distinction between bosons and fermions. It can also handle potentials with
            a singularity at the origin.

    <div class="project">
        <h3>Wave simulation</h3>
        <p>
            I created a simple simulation of a 2D wave using the Runge-Kutta method. The library allows for
            different boundary conditions, initial conditions, and obstacles. The simulation can be exported to a GIF.
